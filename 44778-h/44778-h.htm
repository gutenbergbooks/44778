<h2>ST. CATHERINE BORNE BY ANGELS.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>
SLOW through the solemn air, in silence sailing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Borne by mysterious angels, strong and fair,</span><br />
She sleeps at last, blest dreams her eyelids veiling,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above this weary world of strife and care.</span><br />
<br />
Lo how she passeth!&mdash;dreamy, slow, and calm:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Scarce wave those broad, white wings, so silvery bright;</span><br />
Those cloudy robes, in star-emblazoned folding,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweep mistily athwart the evening light.</span><br />
<br />
Far, far below, the dim, forsaken earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The foes that threaten, or the friends that weep;</span><br />
Past, like a dream, the torture and the pain:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For so He giveth his beloved sleep.</span><br />
<br />
The restless bosom of the surging ocean<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gives back the image as the cloud floats o'er,</span><br />
Hushing in glassy awe his troubled motion;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">For one blest moment he complains no more.</span><br />
<br />
Like the transparent golden floor of heaven,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His charmed waters lie as in a dream,</span><br />
And glistening wings, and starry robes unfolding,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And serious angel eyes far downward gleam.</span><br />
<br />
O restless sea! thou seemest all enchanted<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By that sweet vision of celestial rest;</span><br />
Where are the winds and tides thy peace that haunted,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So still thou seemest, so glorified and blest!</span><br />
<br />
Ah, sea! to-morrow, that sweet scene forgotten,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dark tides and tempests shall thy bosom rear;</span><br />
And thy complaining waves, with restless motion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall toss their hands in their old wild despair.</span><br />
<br />
So o'er our hearts sometimes the sweet, sad story<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of suffering saints, borne homeward crowned and blest,</span><br />
Shines down in stillness with a tender glory,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And makes a mirror there of breathless rest.</span><br />
<br />
For not alone in those old Eastern regions<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are Christ's beloved ones tried by cross and chain;</span><br />
In many a house are his elect ones hidden,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His martyrs suffering in their patient pain.</span><br />
<br />
The rack, the cross, life's weary wrench of woe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The world sees not, as slow, from day to day,</span><br />
In calm, unspoken patience, sadly still,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The loving spirit bleeds itself away.</span><br />
<br />
But there are hours when, from the heavens unfolding,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come down the angels with the glad release;</span><br />
And we look upward, to behold in glory<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our suffering loved ones borne away to peace.</span><br />
<br />
Ah, brief the calm! the restless wave of feeling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rises again when the bright cloud sweeps by,</span><br />
And our unrestful souls reflect no longer<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">That tender vision of the upper sky.</span><br />
<br />
Espoused Lord of the pure saints in glory,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To whom all faithful souls affianced are,</span><br />
Breathe down thy peace into our restless spirits,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And make a lasting, heavenly vision there.</span><br />
<br />
So the bright gates no more on us shall close;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No more the cloud of angels fade away;</span><br />
And we shall walk, amid life's weary strife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the calm light of thine eternal day.</span><br /><br /><br />

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTE:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1">[A]</a> According to this legend, Catherine was a noble maiden
of Alexandria, distinguished alike by birth, riches, beauty, and
the rarest gifts of genius and learning. In the flower of her
life she consecrated herself to the service of her Redeemer,
and cheerfully suffered for his sake the loss of wealth, friends,
and the esteem of the world. Banishment, imprisonment,
and torture were in vain tried to shake the constancy of her
faith; and at last she was bound upon the torturing-wheel for
a cruel death. But the angels descended, so says the story,
rent the wheel, and bore her away, through the air, far over
the sea, to Mount Sinai, where her body was left to repose,
and her soul ascended with them to heaven.</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE CHARMER.</h2>

<div class='blockquot'>

<p>"<i>Socrates.</i> However, you and Simmias appear to me as if
you wished to sift this subject more thoroughly, and to be
afraid, like children, lest, on the soul's departure from the
body, winds should blow it away.</p>

<p>"Upon this Cebes said, 'Endeavor to teach us better, Socrates.
Perhaps there is a childish spirit in our breast that
has such a dread. Let us endeavor to persuade him not to
be afraid of death, as of hobgoblins.'</p>

<p>"'But you must charm him every day,' said Socrates, 'until
you have quieted his fears.'</p>

<p>"'But whence, O Socrates,' he said, 'can we procure a skilful
charmer for such a case, now you are about to leave us.'</p>

<p>"'Greece is wide, Cebes,' he said, 'and in it surely there
are skilful men; and there are many barbarous nations, all of
which you should search, seeking such a charmer, sparing
neither money nor toil.'"&mdash;Last words of Socrates, as narrated
by Plato in the <i>Phædo</i>.</p></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>
WE need that charmer, for our hearts are sore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With longings for the things that may not be,</span><br />
Faint for the friends that shall return no more,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dark with distrust, or wrung with agony.</span><br />
<br />
"What is this life? and what to us is death?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whence came we? whither go? and where are those</span><br />
Who, in a moment stricken from our side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Passed to that land of shadow and repose?</span><br />
<br />
"And are they all dust? and dust must we become?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or are they living in some unknown clime?</span><br />
Shall we regain them in that far-off home,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And live anew beyond the waves of time?</span><br />
<br />
"O man divine! on thee our souls have hung;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou wert our teacher in these questions high;</span><br />
But ah! this day divides thee from our side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And veils in dust thy kindly-guiding eye.</span><br />
<br />
"Where is that Charmer whom thou bidst us seek?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On what far shores may his sweet voice be heard?</span><br />
When shall these questions of our yearning souls<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be answered by the bright Eternal Word?"</span><br />
<br />
So spake the youth of Athens, weeping round,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Socrates lay calmly down to die;</span><br />
So spake the sage, prophetic of the hour<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When earth's fair morning star should rise on high.</span><br />
<br />
They found Him not, those youths of soul divine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long seeking, wandering, watching on life's shore;</span><br />
Reasoning, aspiring, yearning for the light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Death came and found them&mdash;doubting as before.</span><br />
<br />
But years passed on; and lo! the Charmer came,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pure, simple, sweet, as comes the silver dew,</span><br />
And the world knew him not,&mdash;he walked alone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Encircled only by his trusting few.</span><br />
<br />
Like the Athenian sage, rejected, scorned,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Betrayed, condemned, his day of doom drew nigh;</span><br />
He drew his faithful few more closely round,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And told them that his hour was come&mdash;to die.</span><br />
<br />
"Let not your heart be troubled," then He said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"My Father's house hath mansions large and fair;</span><br />
I go before you to prepare your place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I will return to take you with me there."</span><br />
<br />
And since that hour the awful foe is charmed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And life and death are glorified and fair;</span><br />
Whither He went we know, the way we know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with firm step press on to meet him there.</span><br />

<h2>KNOCKING.</h2>

<div class='verse'>"Behold, I stand at the door and knock."<br /></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>
KNOCKING, knocking, ever knocking?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who is there?</span><br />
'Tis a pilgrim, strange and kingly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Never such was seen before;&mdash;</span><br />
Ah, sweet soul, for such a wonder<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Undo the door.</span><br />
<br />
No,&mdash;that door is hard to open;<br />
Hinges rusty, latch is broken;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bid Him go.</span><br />
Wherefore, with that knocking dreary<br />
Scare the sleep from one so weary?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Say Him,&mdash;no.</span><br />

</div>

<div class='poem1'>
Knocking, knocking, ever knocking?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What! Still there?</span><br />
O, sweet soul, but once behold Him,<br />
With the glory-crownéd hair;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>And those eyes, so strange and tender,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Waiting there;</span><br />
Open! Open! Once behold Him,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Him, so fair.</span><br />
<br />
Ah, that door! Why wilt Thou vex me,<br />
Coming ever to perplex me?<br />
For the key is stiffly rusty,<br />
And the bolt is clogged and dusty;<br />
Many-fingered ivy-vine<br />
Seals it fast with twist and twine;<br />
Weeds of years and years before<br />
Choke the passage of that door.<br />
<br />
Knocking! knocking! What! still knocking?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He still there?</span><br />
What's the hour? The night is waning,&mdash;<br />
In my heart a drear complaining,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And a chilly, sad unrest!</span><br />
Ah, this knocking! It disturbs me,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>Scares my sleep with dreams unblest!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Give me rest,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Rest,&mdash;ah, rest!</span><br />
<br />
Rest, dear soul, He longs to give thee;<br />
Thou hast only dreamed of pleasure,<br />
Dreamed of gifts and golden treasure,<br />
Dreamed of jewels in thy keeping,<br />
Waked to weariness of weeping;&mdash;<br />
Open to thy soul's one Lover,<br />
And thy night of dreams is over,&mdash;<br />
The true gifts He brings have seeming<br />
More than all thy faded dreaming!<br />
<br />
Did she open? Doth she? Will she?<br />
So, as wondering we behold,<br />
Grows the picture to a sign,<br />
Pressed upon your soul and mine;<br />
For in every breast that liveth<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>Is that strange mysterious door;&mdash;<br />
Though forsaken and betangled,<br />
Ivy-gnarled and weed-bejangled,<br />
Dusty, rusty, and forgotten;&mdash;<br />
There the piercéd hand still knocketh,<br />
And with ever-patient watching,<br />
With the sad eyes true and tender,<br />
With the glory-crownéd hair,&mdash;<br />
Still a God is waiting there.<br />

<h2>THE OLD PSALM TUNE.</h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>
YOU asked, dear friend, the other day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why still my charméd ear</span><br />
Rejoiceth in uncultured tone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That old psalm tune to hear?</span><br />
<br />
I've heard full oft, in foreign lands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The grand orchestral strain,</span><br />
Where music's ancient masters live,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Revealed on earth again,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Where breathing, solemn instruments,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In swaying clouds of sound,</span><br />
Bore up the yearning, trancéd soul,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like silver wings around;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
I've heard in old St. Peter's dome,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where clouds of incense rise,</span><br />
Most ravishing the choral swell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mount upwards to the skies.</span><br />
<br />
And well I feel the magic power,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When skilled and cultured art</span><br />
Its cunning webs of sweetness weaves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Around the captured heart.</span><br />
<br />
But yet, dear friend, though rudely sung,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That old psalm tune hath still</span><br />
A pulse of power beyond them all<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My inmost soul to thrill.</span><br />
<br />
Those halting tones that sound to you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are not the tones I hear;</span><br />
But voices of the loved and lost<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">There meet my longing ear.</span><br />
<br />
I hear my angel mother's voice,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those were the words she sung;</span><br />
I hear my brother's ringing tones,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As once on earth they rung;</span><br />
<br />
And friends that walk in white above<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come round me like a cloud,</span><br />
And far above those earthly notes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their singing sounds aloud.</span><br />
<br />
There may be discord, as you say;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those voices poorly ring;</span><br />
But there's no discord in the strain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those upper spirits sing.</span><br />
<br />
For they who sing are of the blest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The calm and glorified,</span><br />
Whose hours are one eternal rest<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">On heaven's sweet floating tide.</span><br />
<br />
Their life is music and accord;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their souls and hearts keep time</span><br />
In one sweet concert with the Lord,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One concert vast, sublime.</span><br />
<br />
And through the hymns they sang on earth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sometimes a sweetness falls</span><br />
On those they loved and left below,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And softly homeward calls,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Bells from our own dear fatherland,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Borne trembling o'er the sea,&mdash;</span><br />
The narrow sea that they have crossed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The shores where we shall be.</span><br />
<br />
O sing, sing on, beloved souls!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sing cares and griefs to rest;</span><br />
Sing, till entrancéd we arise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To join you 'mong the blest.</span><br />

Its gentle breezes fan our cheek;<br />

For mortal words are not for them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To utter or partake.</span><br />

So thin, so soft, so sweet, they glide,<br />

Sweet souls around us! watch us still;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Press nearer to our side;</span><br />
Into our thoughts, into our prayers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With gentle helpings glide.</span><br />
<br />
Let death between us be as naught,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dried and vanished stream;</span><br />
Your joy be the reality,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our suffering life the dream.</span><br />

<div class='drop-cap'>
O WONDROUS mother! since the dawn of time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was ever love, was ever grief, like thine?</span><br />
O highly favored in thy joy's deep flow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And favored, even in this, thy bitterest woe!</span><br />
<br />
Poor was that home in simple Nazareth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where, fairly growing, like some silent flower,</span><br />
Last of a kingly race, unknown and lowly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O desert lily, passed thy childhood's hour.</span><br />
<br />
The world knew not the tender, serious maiden,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who through deep loving years so silent grew,</span><br />
Full of high thought and holy aspiration,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which the o'ershadowing God alone might view.</span><br />

And then it came, that message from the highest,<br />

The almighty wings thy prayerful soul o'erspread,<br />

<br />
What visions then of future glory filled thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The chosen mother of that King unknown,</span><br />
Mother fulfiller of all prophecy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which, through dim ages, wondering seers had shown!</span><br />
<br />
Well did thy dark eye kindle, thy deep soul<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rise into billows, and thy heart rejoice;</span><br />
Then woke the poet's fire, the prophet's song,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tuned with strange burning words thy timid voice.</span><br />
<br />
Then, in dark contrast, came the lowly manger,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The outcast shed, the tramp of brutal feet;</span><br />
Again behold earth's learned and her lowly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sages and shepherds, prostrate at thy feet.</span><br />
<br />
Then to the temple bearing&mdash;hark again<br />

O, highly favored thou in many an hour<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spent in lone musings with thy wondrous Son,</span><br />
When thou didst gaze into that glorious eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hold that mighty hand within thine own.</span><br />
<br />
Blest through those thirty years, when in thy dwelling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He lived a God disguised with unknown power;</span><br />
And thou his sole adorer, his best love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Trusting, revering, waited for his hour.</span><br />
<br />
Blest in that hour, when called by opening heaven<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With cloud and voice, and the baptizing flame,</span><br />
Up from the Jordan walked th' acknowledged stranger,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And awe-struck crowds grew silent as he came.</span><br />
<br />
Blessed, when full of grace, with glory crowned,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">He from both hands almighty favors poured,</span><br />
And, though He had not where to lay his head,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brought to his feet alike the slave and lord.</span><br />
<br />
Crowds followed; thousands shouted, "Lo, our King!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fast beat thy heart. Now, now the hour draws nigh:</span><br />
Behold the crown, the throne, the nations bend!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, no! fond mother, no! behold him die!</span><br />
<br />
Now by that cross thou tak'st thy final station,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shar'st the last dark trial of thy Son;</span><br />
Not with weak tears or woman's lamentation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But with high, silent anguish, like his own.</span><br />
<br />
Hail! highly favored, even in this deep passion;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hail! in this bitter anguish thou art blest,&mdash;</span><br />
Blest in the holy power with Him to suffer<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those deep death-pangs that lead to higher rest.</span><br />
<br />
All now is darkness; and in that deep stillness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The God-man wrestles with that mighty woe;</span><br />
Hark to that cry, the rock of ages rending,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'Tis finished!" Mother, all is glory now!</span><br />
<br />
By sufferings mighty as his mighty soul<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hath the Redeemer risen forever blest;</span><br />

Fair are the flowers that wreathe his dewy locks,<br />

<br />
Fair are the silent foldings of his robes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Falling with saintly calmness to his feet;</span><br />
And when he walks, each floweret to his will<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With living pulse of sweet accord doth beat.</span><br />

Every green leaf thrills to its tender heart,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the mild summer radiance of his eye;</span><br />
No fear of storm, or cold, or bitter frost,<br />

<br />
And all our pleasant haunts of earthly love<br />

Forgetful of the high, mysterious right<br />

But when some sunny spot in those bright fields<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Needs the fair presence of an added flower,</span><br />
Down sweeps a starry angel in the night:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At morn, the rose has vanished from our bower.</span><br />

Where stood our tree, our flower, there is a grave!<br />

<br />
Dear friend, no more upon that lonely mound,<br />

Drop thou the tear, but raise the fainting eye<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond the autumn mists of earthly grief.</span><br />

Sleeps tranquilly that youthful form,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those blue unclouded eyes.</span><br />

Around the soft, green swelling mound<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Against a coming day.</span><br />
"These roots are dry, and brown, and sere;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why plant them here?" he said,</span><br />

"Dear child, within each sere dead form<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There sleeps a living flower,</span><br />
And angel-like it shall arise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In spring's returning hour."</span><br />
Ah, deeper down&mdash;cold, dark, and chill&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We buried our heart's flower,</span><br />
But angel-like shall he arise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In spring's immortal hour.</span><br />
<br />
In blue and yellow from its grave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Springs up the crocus fair,</span><br />
And God shall raise those bright blue eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those sunny waves of hair.</span><br />
Not for a fading summer's morn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not for a fleeting hour,</span><br />
But for an endless age of bliss,<br />

There go the faces of our best beloved,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whelmed in the vortex of its wild despair.</span><br />
<br />
Whose son is safe? whose brother, and whose home?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dashing spray beats out the household fire;</span><br />
By blackened ashes weep our widowed souls<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over the embers of our lost desire.</span><br />
<br />
By pauses, in the fitful moaning storm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We hear triumphant notes of battle roll.</span><br />
Too soon the triumph sinks in funeral wail;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The muffled drum, the death march, shakes the soul!</span><br />
<br />
Rocks on all sides, and breakers! at the helm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Weak human hand and weary human eyes.</span><br />
The shout and clamor of our dreary strife<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Goes up conflicting to the angry skies.</span><br />
<br />
But for all this, O timid hearts, be strong;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be of good cheer, for, though the storm must be,</span><br />
<i>It hath its Master:</i> from the depths shall rise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">New heavens, new earth, where shall be no more sea.</span><br />
<br />
No sea, no tossing, no unrestful storm!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forever past the anguish and the strife;</span><br />
The poor old weary earth shall bloom again,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the bright foliage of that better life.</span><br />
<br />
And war, and strife, and hatred, shall be past,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And misery be a forgotten dream.</span><br />
The Shepherd God shall lead his peaceful fold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the calm meadows and the quiet stream.</span><br />
<br />
Be still, be still, and know that he is God;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be calm, be trustful; work, and watch, and pray,</span><br />
Till from the throes of this last anguish rise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The light and gladness of that better day.</span><br />

ONE year ago,&mdash;a ringing voice,<br />

Only a year,&mdash;no voice, no smile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No glance of eye,</span><br />
No clustering curls of golden hair,<br />

What joyous hopes, what high resolves,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">What generous strife!</span><br />

Of all that beauty, life, and joy<br />

<br />
One year,&mdash;one year,&mdash;one little year,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so much gone!</span><br />
And yet the even flow of life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Moves calmly on.</span><br />

The grave grows green, the flowers bloom fair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above that head;</span><br />
No sorrowing tint of leaf or spray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says he is dead.</span><br />
<br />
No pause or hush of merry birds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sing above,</span><br />
Tells us how coldly sleeps below<br />

The veil! the veil! so thin, so strong!<br />

The mystic veil! when shall it fall,<br />

<br />
Not dead, not sleeping, not even gone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But present still,</span><br />
And waiting for the coming hour<br />

COMING down a golden street<br />
I beheld my vanished one,<br />
And he moveth on a cloud,<br />
And his forehead wears a star;<br />
And his blue eyes, deep and holy,<br />
Fixed as in a blessed dream,<br />
See some mystery of joy,<br />
Some unuttered depth of love.<br />
<br />
And his vesture is as blue<br />
As the skies of summer are,<br />
Falling with a saintly sweep,<br />
With a sacred stillness swaying;<br />
And he presseth to his bosom<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>Harp of strange and mystic fashion,<br />
And his hands, like living pearls,<br />
Wander o'er the golden strings.<br />

Every memory of sorrow,<br />
Every heart-ache, every anguish,<br />
Every fear for the to-morrow,<br />
Melt away in charméd rest.<br />

And there be around him many,<br />
Bright with robes like evening clouds,&mdash;<br />
Tender green and clearest amber,<br />
Crimson fading into rose,<br />
Robes of flames and robes of silver,&mdash;<br />

How they float and wreathe and brighten,<br />
Bending low their starry brows,<br />
Singing with a tender cadence,<br />
And their hands, like spotless lilies,<br />
Folded on their prayerful breasts.<br />
In their singing seem to mingle<br />
Tender airs of by-gone days;&mdash;<br />
Mother-hymnings by the cradle,<br />
Mother-moanings by the grave,<br />
Songs of human love and sorrow,<br />
Songs of endless love and rest;&mdash;<br />
In the pauses of that music<br />
Every throb of sorrow dies.<br />

O my own, my heart's belovéd,<br />

To this world's impurity?&mdash;<br />
Lo! it passeth, it dissolveth,<br />

I am charmed into forgetting<br />
Autumn winds and dreary grave.<br />

<h2>LINES</h2>

<div class='verse'>SUGGESTED BY THE DEATH OF MRS. PROFESSOR STUART
OF ANDOVER, MASS.</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>
HOW quiet, through the hazy autumn air,<br />
The elm-boughs wave with many a gold-flecked leaf!<br />
How calmly float the dreamy mantled clouds<br />
Through these still days of autumn, fair and brief!<br />
<br />
Our Andover stands thoughtful, fair, and calm,<br />
Waiting to lay her summer glories by<br />
E'er the bright flush shall kindle all her pines,<br />
And her woods blaze with autumn's heraldry.<br />
<br />
By the old mossy wall the golden-rod<br />
Waves as aforetime, and the purple sprays<br />
Of starry asters quiver to the breeze,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>Rustling all stilly through the forest ways.<br />
<br />
No voice of triumph from those silent skies<br />
Breaks on the calm, and speaks of glories near,<br />
Nor bright wings flutter, nor fair glistening robes<br />
Proclaim that heavenly messengers are here.<br />
<br />
Yet in our midst an angel hath come down,<br />
Troubling the waters in a peaceful home;<br />
And from that home, of life's long sickness healed,<br />
A saint hath risen, where pain no more may come.<br />
<br />
Christ's fair elect one, from a hidden life<br />
Of loving deeds and words of gentleness,<br />
Hath passed where all are loving and beloved,<br />
Beyond all weariness and all distress.<br />
<br />
Calm, like a lamb in shepherd's bosom borne,<br />
Quiet and trustful hath she sunk to rest;<br />
God breathed in tenderness the sweet "Well done!"<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>That scarce awoke a trance so still and blest.<br />
<br />
Ye who remember the long loving years,<br />
The patient mother's hourly martyrdom,<br />
The self-renouncing wisdom, the calm trust,<br />
Rejoice for her whose day of rest is come!<br />
<br />
Father and mother, now united, stand<br />
Waiting for you to bind the household chain;<br />
The tent is struck, the home is gone before,<br />
And tarries for you on the heavenly plain.<br />
<br />
By every wish repressed and hope resigned,<br />
Each cross accepted and each sorrow borne,<br />
She dead yet speaketh, she doth beckon you<br />
To tread the path her patient feet have worn.<br />
<br />
Each year that world grows richer and more dear<br />
With the bright freight washed from life's stormy shore;<br />
O goodly clime, how lovely is thy strand,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>With those dear faces seen on earth no more!<br />
<br />
The veil between this world and that to come<br />
Grows tremulous and quivers with their breath;<br />
Dimly we hear their voices, see their hands,<br />
Inviting us to the release of death.<br />
<br />
O Thou, in whom thy saints above, below,<br />
Are one and undivided, grant us grace<br />
In patience yet to bear our daily cross,&mdash;<br />
In patience run our hourly shortening race!<br />
<br />
And while on earth we wear the servant's form,<br />
And while life's labors ever toilful be,<br />
Breathe in our souls the joyful confidence<br />
We are already kings and priests with thee.<br />

<h2>SUMMER STUDIES.</h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>
WHY shouldst thou study in the month of June<br />
In dusky books of Greek and Hebrew lore,<br />
When the Great Teacher of all glorious things<br />
Passes in hourly light before thy door?<br />
<br />
There is a brighter book unrolling now;<br />
Fair are its leaves as is the tree of heaven,<br />
All veined and dewed and gemmed with wondrous signs,<br />
To which a healing mystic power is given.<br />
<br />
A thousand voices to its study call,<br />
From the fair hill-top, from the waterfall,<br />
Where the bird singeth, and the yellow bee,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>And the breeze talketh from the airy tree.<br />
<br />
Now is that glorious resurrection time<br />
When all earth's buried beauties have new birth:<br />
Behold the yearly miracle complete,&mdash;<br />
God hath created a new heaven and earth!<br />
<br />
No tree that wants its joyful garments now,<br />
No flower but hastes his bravery to don;<br />
God bids thee to this marriage feast of joy,<br />
Let thy soul put the wedding garment on.<br />
<br />
All fringed with festal gold the barberry stands;<br />
The ferns, exultant, clap their new-made wings;<br />
The hemlock rustles broideries of fresh green,<br />
And thousand bells of pearl the blueberry rings.<br />
<br />
The long, weird fingers of the old white-pines<br />
Do beckon thee into the flickering wood,<br />
Where moving spots of light show mystic flowers,<br />
And wavering music fills the dreamy hours.<br />

Hast thou no <i>time</i> for all this wondrous show,&mdash;<br />
No thought to spare? Wilt thou forever be<br />
With thy last year's dry flower-stalk and dead leaves,<br />
And no new shoot or blossom on thy tree?<br />
<br />
See how the pines push off their last year's leaves.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>And stretch beyond them with exultant bound:<br />
The grass and flowers, with living power, o'ergrow<br />
Their last year's remnants on the greening ground.<br />
<br />
Wilt thou, then, all thy wintry feelings keep,<br />
The old dead routine of thy book-writ lore,<br />
Nor deem that God can teach, by one bright hour,<br />
What life hath never taught to thee before?<br />
<br />
See what vast leisure, what unbounded rest,<br />
Lie in the bending dome of the blue sky:<br />
Ah! breathe that life-born languor from thy breast,<br />
And know once more a child's unreasoning joy.<br />
<br />
Cease, cease to <i>think</i>, and be content <i>to be</i>;<br />
Swing safe at anchor in fair Nature's bay;<br />
Reason no more, but o'er thy quiet soul<br />
Let God's sweet teachings ripple their soft way.<br />
<br />
Soar with the birds, and flutter with the leaf;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>Dance with the seeded grass in fringy play;<br />
Sail with the cloud, wave with the dreaming pine,<br />
And float with Nature all the livelong day.<br />
<br />
Call not such hours an idle waste of time,&mdash;<br />
Land that lies fallow gains a quiet power;<br />
It treasures, from the brooding of God's wings,<br />
Strength to unfold the future tree and flower.<br />
<br />
And when the summer's glorious show is past,<br />
Its miracles no longer charm thy sight,<br />
The treasured riches of those thoughtful hours<br />
Shall make thy wintry musings warm and bright.<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>Let my soul calm itself, O Christ, in thee!<br />
<br />
Between the mysteries of death and life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou standest, loving, guiding, not explaining;</span><br />
We ask, and thou art silent; yet we gaze,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And our charmed hearts forget their drear complaining.</span><br />
No crushing fate, no stony destiny,<br />
O Lamb that hast been slain, we find in thee!<br />
<br />
The many waves of thought, the mighty tides,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ground-swell that rolls up from other lands,</span><br />
From far-off worlds, from dim, eternal shores,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose echo dashes on life's wave-worn strands,</span><br />
This vague, dark tumult of the inner sea<br />
Grows calm, grows bright, O risen Lord, in thee!<br />
<br />
Thy piercéd hand guides the mysterious wheels;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy thorn-crowned brow now wears the crown of power;</span><br />
<br />
And when the dread enigma presseth sore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy patient voice saith, "Watch with me one hour."</span><br />
As sinks the moaning river in the sea<br />
In silver peace, so sinks my soul in thee!<br />

<h2>V.<br />

FOURTH HOUR.</h2>

<div class='verse'>THE SORROWS OF MARY.</div>

<div class='verse'><small>DEDICATED TO THE MOTHERS WHO HAVE LOST SONS IN
THE LATE WAR.</small></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>
I SLEPT, but my heart was waking,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And out in my dreams I sped,</span><br />
Through the streets of an ancient city,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where Jesus, the Lord, lay dead.</span><br />
<br />
He was lying all cold and lowly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the sepulchre was sealed,</span><br />
And the women that bore the spices<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had come from the holy field.</span><br />
<br />
There is feasting in Pilate's palace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is revel in Herod's hall,</span><br />
Where the lute and the sounding instrument<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To mirth and merriment call.</span><br />
<br />
"I have washed my hands," said Pilate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And what is the Jew to me?"</span><br />
"I have missed my chance," said Herod,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"One of his wonders to see.</span><br />
<br />
"But why should our courtly circle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the thought give further place?</span><br />
All dreams, save of pleasure and beauty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bid the dancers' feet efface."</span><br />

<br />
I saw a light from a casement,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And entered a lowly door,</span><br />
Where a woman, stricken and mournful,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sat in sackcloth on the floor.</span><br />
<br />
There Mary, the mother of Jesus,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And John, the belovéd one,</span><br />
With a few poor friends beside them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were mourning for Him that was gone.</span><br />
<br />
And before the mother was lying<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That crown of cruel thorn,</span><br />
Wherewith they crowned that gentle brow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In mockery that morn.</span><br />
<br />
And her ears yet ring with the anguish<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of that last dying cry,&mdash;</span><br />
That mighty appeal of agony<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">That shook both earth and sky.</span><br />
<br />
O God, what a shaft of anguish<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was that dying voice from the tree!&mdash;</span><br />
From Him the only spotless,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Why hast Thou forsaken me?"</span><br />
<br />
And was he of God forsaken?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They ask, appalled with dread;</span><br />
Is evil crowned and triumphant,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And goodness vanquished and dead?</span><br />
<br />
Is there, then, no God in Jacob?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is the star of Judah dim?</span><br />
For who would our God deliver,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If he would not deliver him?</span><br />
<br />
If God <i>could</i> not deliver,&mdash;what hope then?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If he <i>would</i> not,&mdash;who ever shall dare</span><br />
To be firm in his service hereafter?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To trust in his wisdom or care?</span><br />
<br />
So darkly the Tempter was saying,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To hearts that with sorrow were dumb;</span><br />
And the poor souls were clinging in darkness to God,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With hands that with anguish were numb.</span><br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
<br />
In my dreams came the third day morning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fairly the day-star shone;</span><br />
But fairer, the solemn angel,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he rolled away the stone.</span><br />
<br />
In the lowly dwelling of Mary,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the dusky twilight chill,</span><br />
There was heard the sound of coming feet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her very heart grew still.</span><br />
<br />
And in the glimmer of dawning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She saw him enter the door,</span><br />
Her Son, all living and real,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Risen, to die no more!</span><br />
<br />
Her Son, all living and real,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Risen no more to die,&mdash;</span><br />
With the power of an endless life in his face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the light of heaven in his eye.</span><br />
<br />
O mourning mothers, so many,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Weeping o'er sons that are dead,</span><br />
Have ye thought of the sorrows of Mary's heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the tears that Mary shed?</span><br />
<br />
Is the crown of thorns before you?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are there memories of cruel scorn?</span><br />
Of hunger and thirst and bitter cold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That your beloved have borne?</span><br />
<br />
Had ye ever a son like Jesus<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To give to a death of pain?</span><br />
Did ever a son so cruelly die,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">But did he die in vain?</span><br />
<br />
Have ye ever thought that all the hopes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That make our earth-life fair</span><br />
Were born in those three bitter days<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Mary's deep despair?</span><br />
<br />
O mourning mothers, so many,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Weeping in woe and pain,</span><br />
Think on the joy of Mary's heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a Son that is risen again.</span><br />
<br />
Have faith in a third-day morning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a resurrection-hour;</span><br />
For what ye sow in weakness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He can raise again in power.</span><br />
<br />
Have faith in the Lord of that thorny crown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the Lord of the piercéd hand;</span><br />
For he reigneth now o'er earth and heaven,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his power who may withstand?</span><br />
<br />
And the hopes that never on earth shall bloom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sorrows forever new,</span><br />
Lay silently down at the feet of Him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who died and is risen for you.</span><br />

<h2>VI.<br />

<small>DAY DAWN.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>
THE dim gray dawn, upon the eastern hills,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brings back to light once more the cheerless scene;</span><br />
But oh! no morning in my Father's house<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is dawning now, for there no night hath been.</span><br />
<br />
Ten thousand thousand now, on Zion's hills,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All robed in white, with palmy crowns, do stray,</span><br />
While I, an exile, far from fatherland,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still wandering, faint along the desert way.</span><br />
<br />
O home! dear home! my own, my native home!<br />
O Father, friends! when shall I look on you?<br />
When shall these weary wanderings be o'er,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>And I be gathered back to stray no more?<br />
<br />
O Thou, the brightness of whose gracious face<br />
These weary, longing eyes have never seen,&mdash;<br />
By whose dear thought, for whose belovéd sake,<br />
My course, through toil and tears, I daily take,&mdash;<br />
<br />
I think of thee when the myrrh-dropping morn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Steps forth upon the purple eastern steep;</span><br />
I think of thee in the fair eventide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the bright-sandalled stars their watches keep.</span><br />
<br />
And trembling hope, and fainting, sorrowing love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On thy dear word for comfort doth rely;</span><br />
And clear-eyed Faith, with strong forereaching gaze,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beholds thee here, unseen, but ever nigh.</span><br />
<br />
Walking in white with thee, she dimly sees,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All beautiful, these lovely ones withdrawn,</span><br />
With whom my heart went upward, as they rose,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like morning stars, to light a coming dawn.</span><br />
<br />
All sinless now, and crowned and glorified,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where'er thou movest move they still with thee,</span><br />
As erst, in sweet communion by thy side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Walked John and Mary in old Galilee.</span><br />
<br />
But hush, my heart! 'T is but a day or two<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Divides thee from that bright, immortal shore.</span><br />
Rise up! rise up! and gird thee for the race!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fast fly the hours, and all will soon be o'er.</span><br />
<br />
Thou hast the new name written in thy soul;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou hast the mystic stone He gives his own.</span><br />
Thy soul, made one with him, shall feel no more<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That she is walking on her path alone.</span><br />

<h2>VII.<br />

<small>WHEN I AWAKE I AM STILL WITH THEE.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>
STILL, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the bird waketh and the shadows flee;</span><br />
Fairer than morning, lovelier than the daylight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dawns the sweet consciousness, <i>I am with Thee</i>!</span><br />
<br />
Alone with Thee, amid the mystic shadows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The solemn hush of nature newly born;</span><br />
Alone with Thee in breathless adoration,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the calm dew and freshness of the morn.</span><br />
<br />
As in the dawning o'er the waveless ocean<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The image of the morning star doth rest,</span><br />
So in this stillness Thou beholdest only<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thine image in the waters of my breast.</span><br />
<br />
Still, still with Thee! as to each new-born morning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A fresh and solemn splendor still is given,</span><br />
So doth this blessed consciousness, awaking,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Breathe, each day, nearness unto Thee and heaven.</span><br />
<br />
When sinks the soul, subdued by toil, to slumber,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its closing eye looks up to Thee in prayer;</span><br />
Sweet the repose beneath the wings o'ershading,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But sweeter still to wake and find Thee there.</span><br />
<br />
So shall it be at last, in that bright morning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the soul waketh and life's shadows flee;</span><br />
O, in that hour, fairer than daylight dawning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall rise the glorious thought, <i>I am with Thee</i>!</span><br />

<h2>A DAY IN THE PAMFILI DORIA.</h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>
THOUGH the hills are cold and snowy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the wind drives chill to-day,</span><br />
My heart goes back to a spring-time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Far, far in the past away.</span><br />
<br />
And I see a quaint old city,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Weary and worn and brown,</span><br />
Where the spring and the birds are so early,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the sun in such light goes down.</span><br />
<br />
I remember that old-times villa,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where our afternoons went by,</span><br />
Where the suns of March flushed warmly,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And spring was in earth and sky.</span><br />
<br />
Out of the mouldering city,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mouldering, old, and gray,</span><br />
We sped, with a lightsome heart-thrill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a sunny, gladsome day,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
For a revel of fresh spring verdure,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a race 'mid springing flowers,</span><br />
For a vision of plashing fountains,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of birds and blossoming bowers.</span><br />
<br />
There were violet banks in the shadows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Violets white and blue;</span><br />
And a world of bright anemones,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That over the terrace grew,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Blue and orange and purple,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rosy and yellow and white,</span><br />
Rising in rainbow bubbles,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Streaking the lawns with light.</span><br />
<br />
And down from the old stone pine-trees,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those far off islands of air,</span><br />
The birds are flinging the tidings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of a joyful revel up there.</span><br />
<br />
And now for the grand old fountains,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tossing their silvery spray,</span><br />
Those fountains so quaint and so many,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That are leaping and singing all day.</span><br />
<br />
Those fountains of strange weird sculpture,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With lichens and moss o'ergrown,</span><br />
Are they marble greening in moss-wreaths?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or moss-wreaths whitening to stone?</span><br />
<br />
Down many a wild, dim pathway<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We ramble from morning till noon;</span><br />
We linger, unheeding the hours,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till evening comes all too soon.</span><br />
<br />
And from out the ilex alleys,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where lengthening shadows play,</span><br />
We look on the dreamy Campagna,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All glowing with setting day,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
All melting in bands of purple,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In swathings and foldings of gold,</span><br />
In ribands of azure and lilac,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a princely banner unrolled.</span><br />
<br />
And the smoke of each distant cottage,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the flash of each villa white,</span><br />
Shines out with an opal glimmer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like gems in a casket of light.</span><br />
<br />
And the dome of old St. Peter's<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a strange translucence glows,</span><br />
Like a mighty bubble of amethyst<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Floating in waves of rose.</span><br />
<br />
In a trance of dreamy vagueness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We, gazing and yearning, behold</span><br />
That city beheld by the prophet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose walls were transparent gold.</span><br />
<br />
And, dropping all solemn and slowly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To hallow the softening spell,</span><br />
There falls on the dying twilight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Ave Maria bell.</span><br />
<br />
With a mournful motherly softness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a weird and weary care,</span><br />
That strange and ancient city<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seems calling the nations to prayer.</span><br />
<br />
And the words that of old the angel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the mother of Jesus brought,</span><br />
Rise like a new evangel,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To hallow the trance of our thought.</span><br />
<br />
With the smoke of the evening incense,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our thoughts are ascending then</span><br />
To Mary, the mother of Jesus,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Jesus, the Master of men.</span><br />
<br />
O city of prophets and martyrs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O shrines of the sainted dead,</span><br />
When, when shall the living day-spring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Once more on your towers be spread?</span><br />
<br />
When He who is meek and lowly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall rule in those lordly halls,</span><br />
And shall stand and feed as a shepherd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The flock which his mercy calls,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
O, then to those noble churches,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To picture and statue and gem,</span><br />
To the pageant of solemn worship,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall the <i>meaning</i> come back again.</span><br />
<br />
And this strange and ancient city,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In that reign of His truth and love,</span><br />
Shall <i>be</i> what it <i>seems</i> in the twilight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The type of that City above.</span><br />

<h2>THE GARDENS OF THE VATICAN.</h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>
SWEET fountains, plashing with a dreamy fall,<br />
And mosses green, and tremulous veils of fern,<br />
And banks of blowing cyclamen, and stars,<br />
Blue as the skies, of myrtle blossoming,<br />
The twilight shade of ilex overhead<br />
O'erbubbling with sweet song of nightingale,<br />
With walks of strange, weird stillness, leading on<br />
'Mid sculptured fragments half to green moss gone,<br />
Or breaking forth amid the violet leaves<br />
With some white gleam of an old world gone by.<br />
Ah! strange, sweet quiet! wilderness of calm,<br />
Gardens of dreamy rest, I long to lay<br />
Beneath your shade the last long sigh, and say,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>Here is my home, my Lord, thy home and mine;<br />
And I, having searched the world with many a tear,<br />
At last have found thee and will stray no more.<br />
But vainly here I seek the Gardener<br />
That Mary saw. These lovely halls beyond,<br />
That airy, sky-like dome, that lofty fane,<br />
Is as a palace whence the king is gone<br />
And taken all the sweetness with himself.<br />
Turn again, Jesus, and possess thine own!<br />
Come to thy temple once more as of old!<br />
Drive forth the money-changers, let it be<br />
A house of prayer for nations. Even so,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Amen! Amen!</span><br />

O FAIREST mansion of a Father's love,<br />
Harmonious! hospitable! with thine arms<br />
Outspread to all, thy fountains ever full,<br />
And, fair as heaven, thy misty, sky-like dome<br />

Above the constellated golden lamps<br />
That burn forever round the holy tomb.<br />

Shall be proclaimed, by thy loud singing choirs,<br />
Like voice of many waters! Then the Lord<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>Shall come into his temple, and make pure<br />
The sons of Levi; then, as once of old,<br />
The blind shall see, the lame leap as an hart,<br />
And to the poor the Gospel shall be preached,<br />
And Easter's silver-sounding trumpets tell,<br />
"The Lord is risen indeed," to die no more.<br />
Hasten it in its time. Amen! Amen!<br />

<h2>THE MISERERE.</h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>
NOT of the earth that music! all things fade;<br />
Vanish the pictured walls! and, one by one,<br />
The starry candles silently expire!<br />
<br />
And now, O Jesus! round that silent cross<br />
A moment's pause, a hush as of the grave.<br />
Now rises slow a silver mist of sound,<br />
And all the heavens break out in drops of grief;<br />
A rain of sobbing sweetness, swelling, dying,<br />
Voice into voice inweaving with sweet throbs,<br />
And fluttering pulses of impassioned moan,&mdash;<br />
Veiled voices, in whose wailing there is awe,<br />
And mysteries of love and agony,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>A yearning anguish of celestial souls,<br />
A shiver as of wings trembling the air,<br />
As if God's shining doves, his spotless birds,<br />
Wailed with a nightingale's heart-break of grief,<br />
In this their starless night, when for our sins<br />
Their sun, their life, their love, hangs darkly there,<br />
Like a slain lamb, bleeding his life away!<br />
